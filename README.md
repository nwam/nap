# nap
Take a nap and play neopets at the same time!
The idea behind nap is to mimic human behaviour on Neopets.com (to avoid getting banned), performing all of the typical tasks a human would do, gaining precious NPs, effortlessly.

# Implemented functionality:
Simple HTTP events which can be performed every X amount of time. (examples include: buying a scratchcard, spinning wheels, daily events)

# In development:
Events which require parsing HTML to choose the next action. (examples include: stocking your shop and pricing items)
